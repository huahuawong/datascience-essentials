## Introductory SQL questions, but I am assuming that you know the basic commands such as SELECT, WHERE, HAVING, NOT, LIKE, IN etc.

### 1. Find the maximum/ highest value according to each group in a table.
Let's say you have a table called EMP with these columns: EMPLOYEE ID, CITY NAME, SALARY

To find the highest salary of employee in each city. We can use `MAX` and `GROUP BY`. So, it'd look something like this:

```
SELECT CITY, MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP
GROUP BY CITY;
```
