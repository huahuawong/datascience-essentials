## Introductory SQL questions, but I am assuming that you know the basic commands such as SELECT, WHERE, HAVING, NOT, LIKE, IN etc.

### 1. Find the maximum/ highest value according to each group in a table.
Let's say you have a table called EMP with these columns: EMPLOYEE ID, CITY NAME, SALARY

To find the highest salary of employee in each city. We can use `MAX` and `GROUP BY`. So, it'd look something like this:

```
SELECT CITY, MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP
GROUP BY CITY;
```

### 2. Same as (1), but we want to find the columns/ IDs that have the highest value. 

Let's say we want to show the dates that have the most unique customers, as well as the total order value registered on those days. And the table has date, customer_id

1. What we can do is to create a CTE that counts the num. of customers on each day.
2. Extract those that ahs the highest value using  `WHERE`, `IN` and `MAX`.

```
WITH T1 AS(
SELECT orderdate, COUNT(DISTINCT customerid) AS counts FROM orders
GROUP BY orderdate
ORDER BY counts DESC)

SELECT * FROM T1 WHERE counts IN 
(SELECT MAX(counts) FROM T1
);
```
