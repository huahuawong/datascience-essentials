### 1. Filtering results
#### To filter results in SQL, there are 3 main functions that can be used, OVER, PARTITION BY, and ROWS
* OVER: Let's say we want to select names, and heights. It'd look something like, `SELECT` name, heights `OVER` ( `ORDER BY` name)
* PARTITION BY: Allows you to further partition the data with the `OVER` command preceding, `SELECT` name, heights `OVER` ( `PARTITION BY` city)
* ROWS: Allows you to only consider preceding and/or following rows while quering data. `SELECT` name, heights, `min`(heights) `OVER` (`ORDER BY` name ROWS between 1 preceding and 1 following)

### 2. Moving average
#### 'Moving average' questions may seem easy, but it could be tough to execute, the important thing is to know that we have to use the `OVER` function.

Let's say we have a table with the orders, and the date order was being placed, and we want to know the 7-day moving average number of orders.

First thing, let's get number of orders per day. and make it a CTE

WITH T1 AS (`SELECT` orderdate, COUNT(1), num_orders_per_day FROM orders
GROUP BY orderdate
ORDER BY 1)

Once, we have this, we can then use `OVER` to find out the moving average

`SELECT` AVG(num_orders_per_day) OVER (ORDER BY orderdate ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
FROM T1

-- The reason we use ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW is so that we can always get the moving average of 7 days, i.e. 1 week. It can be adjsuted according to which moving 
-- avergae that we're looking at
