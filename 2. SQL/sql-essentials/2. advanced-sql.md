### 1. Filtering results
#### To filter results in SQL, there are 3 main functions that can be used, OVER, PARTITION BY, and ROWS
* OVER: Let's say we want to select names, and heights. It'd look something like, `SELECT` name, heights `OVER` ( `ORDER BY` name)
* PARTITION BY: Allows you to further partition the data with the `OVER` command preceding, `SELECT` name, heights `OVER` ( `PARTITION BY` city)
* ROWS: Allows you to only consider preceding and/or following rows while quering data. `SELECT` name, heights, `min`(heights) `OVER` (`ORDER BY` name ROWS between 1 preceding and 1 following)
