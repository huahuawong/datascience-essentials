### Q1. Alice and Bob are choosing their top 3 shows from a list of 50 shows. Assume that they choose independently of one another. Being relatively new to Hulu, assume also that they choose randomly within the 50 shows. What is the expected number of shows they have in common, and what is the probability that they do not have any shows in common?

1. First, we should recognize that we are looking at discrete probability, we are trying to see if x = 0, 1, 2, 3
2. Next, we can look into probability of each x. let's say x = 1 (one match). That means there are 50 ways to choose that one match, Alice can then choose the remaining 2 from 40 choices. Bob can then choose from the other 47 choices. 
3. Repeat the process for other x
