### 1. This problem was asked by Wayfair.

### If you are selling a product and want to decrease the shipment time from 2 days to 1 day to increase your amount of customers, what are 2 ways to quantify it and 2 risks of this idea?

2 ways to quantify it, not sure what they meant by quantify it, but I am assuming it's referring to metrics that may be involved in this process.

1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), also known as the Wilson formula, is a calculation used to determine the least costly number of units to order. The aim is to minimise the cost of ordering and holding stock, while still meeting demand and service level requirements. 
2. Number of safe stocks left in the inventory
3. Lead Time Analysis (amount of time between when an order is placed and when it is shipped)

2 risks

1. Space/ Storage requirements
2. Stock wasted
