### 1. What is the difference between uncorrelated varibale V.S. independent variable?
Uncorrelated variable means that there are no linear dependence between the variables, whereas independent variable means that there are no dependence of any type
between the two variables. This means that all indeopendent variables are uncorrelated but it may not always be the case the other way arond.

### 2. What is PCA? And what are the assumptions?
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that is commonly used to analyze large dimensions of data, by preserving maximum amount of information.

PCA assumes a correlation between features. If the features (or dimensions or columns, in tabular data) are not correlated, PCA will be unable to 
determine principal components. PCA also assumes multivariate normality and large sample size.
